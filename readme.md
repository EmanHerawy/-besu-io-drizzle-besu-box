# Drizzle & Hyperledger Besu Truffle Box

This box gives you a boilerplate to get up and running quickly with Drizzle & Truffle on a Hyperledger Besu chain.

## Installation

First ensure you are in a new and empty directory.

1. Run the `unbox` command with `npx` and skip to step 3. This will install all necessary dependencies.

```
npx truffle unbox EmanHerawy/besu-drizzle-truffle-box
```

2. Alternatively, you can install Truffle globally and then run the `unbox` command.

```
npm install -g truffle
truffle unbox EmanHerawy/besu-drizzle-truffle-box
```

3. Run the development console. This will instantiate a local chain for you to test that Truffle is working properly.

```
truffle develop
```

4. Ensure that you're able to both compile, test, and finally migrate your contracts to your local chain.

```
compile
test
migrate
```

5. If everything looks good, you can exit the Truffle console with `.exit`.

## Run  Hyperledger Besu

1. Clone Besu Quickstart Source CodeÔÉÅ  `git clone https://github.com/PegaSysEng/besu-quickstart.git`.

2. Build Docker Images and Start Services and Network `./run.sh`

3. The `run.sh` script builds the images, and runs the containers.

4. When the process ends, it lists the running, followed by a list of the endpoints.


5. Migrate your contracts to your Hyperledger Besu chain!

```
truffle migrate --network quickstartWallet
```

## Connect MetaMask to your Hyperledger Besu Chain

1. In the `Networks` switcher in MetaMask, choose `Custom RPC`.

2. Find the `New Network` section, and click `Advanced Options`.
3. Enter the JSON-RPC HTTP service endpoint displayed when you started the private network.
## Start Your React App

1. Open the `/app` directory and start the development server.
```
export PORT=30001
cd app && npm run start
```

2. The development server will open a browser at `http://localhost:30001` by default.

3. Attempt to change the `Stored Value` of `SimpleStorage` -- you should see the refresh icon until the transaction is confirmed, at which point the `Stored Value` of `SimpleStorage` should automatically update.

## Creating a Transaction Using MetaMask

Before sending transactions, you need to create an account or use one of the accounts below created during the genesis of this private test network.
